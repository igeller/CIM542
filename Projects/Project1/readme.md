# Project 1: Light and Emotion

#### Project Info:
The goal of the the project was to combine our knowledge of led programming and the circuit cutter to represent an emotion. The emotion I chose to represent is **lulled** (meaning calm down, quiet).

To represent the emotion of being pulled into sleep i generated a nightlight with a calming on and off sequence.


#### Process
I used a 3d pentagon to create the "shade" for the lights. I cut stars, moons, and clouds into the panels that would appear on the upper half, with the intention that the light would shine to the walls in such shapes.
